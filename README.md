| Description  | A Network Analyst tool to intelligently calculate evacuation routes |

####About
CASPER (Capacity-Aware Shortest Path Evacuation Routing) is a custom Network Analyst tool that uses a state-of-the-art routing algorithm to produce evacuation routes to the nearest safe area for each evacuee or group of evacuees. It is an innovative new ArcGIS tool that can help city officials, public safety and other emergency departments to perform evacuation planning more intelligently and efficiently.

####Requirement
 - [Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 
2013](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784) (Install both x86 and x64 versions)
 - ArcGIS Desktop 10.3
 - Network Analyst Extension
 - (Optional) Background Geoprocessing (64-bit)
 - (Optional) ArcGIS Desktop C++ SDK: only if you want to compile the program yourself


####Using the Code
The project can be compiled with VS2013 or later. You need to install ArcGIS Desktop C++ SDK and [Boost libraries](http://www.boost.org/). download the latest version, extract it on your PC, then add its path to VS C++ project include directories ([more info](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/73f9s62w.aspx)). You also need a post-commit and a post-checkout git hook to generate an extra header file. Use the following sample:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "post-checkout script: Writing git describe to gitdescribe.h"

echo "#ifndef GIT_DESCRIBE" > src/gitdescribe.h
echo "#define GIT_DESCRIBE \"`git describe`\"" >> src/gitdescribe.h
echo "#endif" >> src/gitdescribe.h
unix2dos src/gitdescribe.h
```

####Installation
In order to install, first unzip the downloaded file.  Next, execute the "install.cmd" script.  This script needs to run as an administrator in Windows Visa and later operating systems.  Make sure any previous CASPER installation is completely uninstalled.  You may find detailed instructions in the user manual.

####Acknowledgement
I would like to thank Esri [Application Prototype Lab (APL)](https://maps.esri.com/), the Esri Network Analyst team, and USC [Spatial Sciences Institute (SSI)](http://spatial.usc.edu/) for their support during the development of this tool. The programing of this tool started when I was a summer intern at Esri in 2011. I worked at APL during that summer and also received tremendous support from the Network Analyst team. After Esri, I continued as a PhD student and research assistant at USC SSI. Thanks to SSI support, I'm still actively developing the CASPER algorithm to improve the future of public safety.
